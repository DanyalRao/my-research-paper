This project presents a Simulink-based performance assessment of a binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) link illustrative of modern mobile communication structures. A discreet end-to-end chain, random bit generation, BPSK modulation, AWGN channel, coherent demodulation, and bit-error count, is constructed completely in Simulink without depen.
